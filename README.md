No special instructions

I chose to make all the products display when no arguments were given into "AND/OR" command to give the user the ability to view all of the products at once.

I initially used the for each loop to iterate through sets in util.h but later switched to using the iterator for loop pattern since that is how it was taught in class. To my understanding, both methods accomplish the same goal efficiently.
